Full-chip mixed-mode simulation (test)

This directory simulates a combination of the digital SPI controller for
hydra 2.0 coupled with an X-FAB XH035 SPICE wrapper containing a power
supply voltage source and the aporc01 power-on-reset cell from A_CELLS to
reset the controller.  The pad cells are contained within the analog part,
and the verilog part does not directly connect the testbench and digital
controller, but runs I/O through the pad cells in the analog part.


For this version
-----------------------------------------------
To run:			./hydra_v2p0_test3.sh
