Full-chip mixed-mode simulation (test)
hydra_v2p0_test1

This directory simulates a very basic combination of the digital SPI controller for
hydra 2.0 coupled with a foundry-non-specific SPICE wrapper containing a power
supply voltage source and a ramp voltage to pulse the reset (RST) pin on the
controller.

For this version
-----------------------------------------------
To run:			./hydra_v2p0_test.sh
