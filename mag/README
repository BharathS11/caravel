Changes made for MPW-two metal fix

----------------------------------
Fixes made only on mask layers m2, via2, and m3.

(1) mgmt_core:  All 32 clock buffers at the 5th tier of the clock
		tree had their outputs tied together in as much
		of a grid as possible, to pull the timing closer
		together.

(2) gpio_control_block:  A new cell gpio_control_block_alt was
		made, having an inverted sense for the "mgmt_ena"
		bit, effectively making it "management disable".
		This modified control block is used everywhere
		except the four pins used by the SPI, which need
		to retain their original setting.  This change
		makes all other GPIO pins user-controlled
		bidirectional pads.

(3) defs.h:  The values for "USER" and "MGMT" are swapped for
		the definitions of various GPIO configurations.

NOTE:  This change requires that all testbenches swap "USER"
and "MGMT" for any settings in the C program for GPIOs 1 to 4,
which have been left unchanged and therefore are now reversed
with respect to the definition in defs.h.
